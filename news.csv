Here you can find the preview, predictions, odds, and how to watch or live stream online free in the United States.By Leonardo HerreraJune 19, 2022 09:12AM EDT June 19, 2022 09:12AM EDTBy Leonardo HerreraBoca Juniors will seek to reach the top of the standings when they visit Barracas¬†today in what will be Matchday 4 of the Argentine League. Here you will find all the information about this game, such as the preview, storylines, predictions and odds. If you want to watch it live, you can do it in the United States on Paramount + (free trial).The ‚ÄúXeneizes‚Äù recovered in Matchday 3 from the loss suffered against Central Cordoba in Santiago del Estero the previous weekend, beating Tigre 5-3 in what was undoubtedly the most interesting game of that Matchday. With 6 points they were only one of the leaders, and that is why the team from La Boca will try to reach the top of the standings.In the case of Barracas Central, they had a bad start with two draws and one loss, numbers that are not encouraging for a team that is looking to get a lot of points so as not to have to suffer with relegation (although at the moment they are quite far). And while they are needed, against a strong team like Boca, a draw might not be a bad result.Date: Sunday, June 19, 2022 Time: 8:30 PM (ET) Location: Islas Malvinas Stadium, Floresta, Argentina Live Stream: Paramount+ET: 8:30 PM CT: 7:30 PM MT: 6:30 PM PT: 5:30 PMThese two teams will play their first professional game, so it will be the beginning of the statistics between them. They had faced each other in the Copa de la Liga, although that competition is a National Cup; and there are also 4 matches from the amateur era for a total of 5 games, all of them won by Boca Juniors.The last confrontation was in the first phase of the Copa de la Liga (that is, not a League confrontation and that is why this Matchday will be the first) and then it was a 2-0 victory for the ""Xeneizes"" with goals from Dario Benedetto (2).The game that Barracas Central and Boca Juniors will play today, June 19 at the Islas Malvinas Stadium, Floresta, Argentina for the Matchday 4 of 2022 Argentine League will be broadcast in the United States on Paramount + (free trial).

The National Flag is synonymous with freedom for all Mexicans in national territory, and represents an extension of Mexico, for those who are abroad.During the term of president Benito Ju√°rez, the flag colors meanings took a different¬†connotation where Green was hope; White was unity (it could not be religion, since president Juarez established a non-religious secular state); and Red was the blood of the national heroes, spilled during the war of independence.The coat of arms and national emblem, was first adopted in 1823 as a representation of the national identity. It is considered one of the most beautiful in the world, both for its image and for what it represents:The mythical Aztec legend that tells about the pilgrimage of more than 300 years made by the ‚ÄúMexica‚Äù people to find the signal sent by their god Huizilopochtli, an eagle perched on a cactus, while devouring a snake. Which at last, conferred them the power to find the exact spot on which to build the great city of Tenochtitlan in the heart of what we now know as Mexico City.Sources: commentsOn Saturday, June 18th, the Yucatan.Cleaning and maintenance work continues in.Despite the fact that there is.Environmentalists call on the Government of.Celia weakened to a tropical depression.The largest migrant caravan to date.Latin America has¬†taken another leftward turn,.Governor Mauricio Vila Dosal held a.Mexico City has set a world.A spider monkey wearing a bulletproof.document.getElementById(""comment"").setAttribute( ""id"", ""ac33e896ef1f4c05b42a62a63645e85f"" );document.getElementById(""c08a1a06c7"").setAttribute( ""id"", ""comment"" );       Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

Godoy Cruz were beaten on the road for the third game running following a 1-0 loss against Rosario Central on Thursday at the Estadio Gigante de Arroyito.The game was level heading into its final 10 minutes after which a late penalty from Gaspar Servio put Rodolfo Diego Flores's men to the sword.With three points from as many games this term, El Bodeguero currently sit 19th in the league table and are in need of a pick-me-up.Coming up next is the challenge of an opposing side who have only lost one of the last eight meetings between the teams dating back to 2014.However, that solitary loss did come in the most recent encounter back in September, when Monday's hosts claimed a 2-1 victory over the away side.Defensa y Justicia played out a third consecutive share of the spoils in a 1-1 draw against Huracan at the Estadio Norberto Tito Tomaghello on Wednesday.Sebastian Beccacece's men opened the scoring in the 17th minute through Carlos Rotondi, but they were pegged back midway through the first half by Franco Cristaldo.El Halcon are 21st in the league table as it stands, level on points with their next opponents heading into Monday's encounter in Mendoza.Having failed to win any of their last four away games across all competitions, the Buenos Aires-based outfit set out to record a rare victory on the road and kickstart their league campaign. Adonis Frias is a huge doubt for this one after he was hauled off with an injury just 12 minutes into Defensa's last outing versus Huracan.Meanwhile, 28-year-old Francisco Pizzini is available to feature once again having served a one-game ban in the aforementioned game.Godoy's Nestor Breitenbruch is ineligible to take part as he is suspended off the back of his sending off against Rosario.The hosts will also be without the services of defender Leonel Gonzalez, who is set to miss a fourth match through a muscle problem. Godoy Cruz possible starting lineup:Rodriguez; Meli, Ortiz, Ferrari, Barrios, Lopez; Bullaude, Acevedo, Abrego; Rodriguez, OjedaDefensa y Justicia possible starting lineup:Unsain; Tripichio, Cardona, Colombo, Soto; Loaiza, Gutierrez; Duarte, Bou, Rotondi; FernandezAs the league table suggests, there is little separating the teams ahead of this one, and we are expecting a tight affair. That said, we also tip the home side to narrowly edge their visitors and nick all three points in the end.

Rodriguez, Insaurralde, Barreto, Vigo; Poblete, Gonzalez; Togni, Benavidez, Fernandez; BenegasEstudiantes possible starting lineup:Andujar; Godoy, Rogel, Lollo, Mas; Castro, Zuqui, Rodriguez, Pellegrini; Del Prete, BoselliEstudiantes seem to have found the right balance to be successful this season, and their tight defensive setup might be challenging for Independiente to break down, while El Leon make the majority of their opportunities count.For data analysis of the most likely results, scorelines and more for this match please click here.

The Spanish language twitter account of the German club, intentionally or not, added fuel to these rumors by posting a picture of Plata next to his national team counterpart Piero Hincapie.¬†Piero Hincapie of Bayer 04 Leverkusen has just completed a rather impressive league campaign of his own. Though naturally a center-halve by trade, the 20-year-old has been used at the left-back role to much positive effect.¬†Over on the right-hand side of defense, however, Gerardo Seoane's Werkself have had difficulty coping with multiple injuries at the right-back position.

Are the Greens actually in the Australian Federal Parliament? Seriously? Do they actually hate Australians that much,‚Äù Mundine told The Daily The Telegraph.‚ÄúAboriginals call themselves Australians all the time.‚ÄúThe Greens are just a fringe university type group trying to run down the country.‚ÄùWhile Northern Territory Senator Jacinta Price also questioned the move saying: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs becoming a little bit childish for leaders to be virtue-signalling about who loves Aboriginal people more‚Äù.Former Labor senator Stephen Conroy slammed the move as an attention-seeking stunt.‚ÄúAdam Bandt is a man desperately trying to grab attention,‚Äù he told Sky News Australia.""Here‚Äôs a bloke that in his heart believed he would be a minister after the election he truly did believe he would have his hands on the reigns of power and he is just deeply, deeply bitter about it.‚ÄúFrankly we should just ignore him because he is going to keep having to do these cheap pathetic stunts to try and draw attention to himself.""Shadow cyber security minister James Paterson labelled Mr Bandt‚Äôs removal of the flag ‚Äúdisappointing and very immature behaviour‚Äù.‚ÄúI thought it was particularly unhelpful and inappropriate for him to co-opt Indigenous Australians as his excuse for why he doesn‚Äôt embrace the flag,‚Äù he told Sky News Australia.‚ÄúHe made a choice to run for the Australian Parliament to represent the Australian people and we have the Australian flag as our national symbol and for him to distance himself from it reflects very poorly on him.‚ÄùLabor MP Peter Kahlil told Peter Stefanovic on Tuesday he had previously witnessed Mr Bandt‚Äôs disdain for the flag at a citizenship ceremony where he refused to wave the flag in celebration of the new Australians.Mr Kahlil also admitted the flag can evoke some offence to certain people but said it still represented Australia and deserved respect.‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a member of the Australian Parliament and yes the Australian flag and the Union Jack it evokes some offence to peoples not just Indigenous peoples,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúI‚Äôm of Egyptian background there was a British colonial period in Egypt but I‚Äôm an Australian and I‚Äôm a member of the Australian Parliament and despite some of that history the flag represents Australia.‚ÄúWe might change it in the future, that‚Äôs fine, but right now that‚Äôs our flag but I respect that flag as a member of the Australian Parliament and so should other members of Parliament as the vast majority of Australian citizens do.‚ÄùNationals Senator Matt Canavan also took aim at the Greens leader saying the move would have distanced himself from the party‚Äôs supporters.‚ÄúI think a lot of Greens voters this morning will be waking up feeling duped because I actually don‚Äôt believe the majority of even Greens voters would support Adam Bandt‚Äôs stance here that disrespects Australia that disrespects our flag,‚Äù he told First Edition.Mr Bandt has claimed he usually removes the Australian flag from his media appearances with the decision coming as the NSW government begins plans to fly the Aboriginal flag on the Sydney Harbour Bridge.To join the conversation, please

Last week, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) was forced to set rarely used price caps to halt runaway wholesale prices at $300 a megawatt-hour, before making the unprecedented decision to suspend the entire electricity market as it neared a meltdown.Outside of Australia, the rest of CLP Group‚Äôs earnings were broadly in line with the same period last year, the company saidAustralians could access a single-shot vaccine for COVID-19 and the flu in coming years as US biotechnology giant Moderna pushes forward with development of a new product that could be made at its Victorian manufacturing site.Chief medical officer at the $US50 billion company, Paul Burton, told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald there had been huge interest from governments around the world for a single vaccine that tackles multiple respiratory diseases.Moderna‚Äôs local operations will be capable of producing products targeting multiple respiratory illnesses.Credit:AP‚ÄúIts [appeal is] a combination of ease of compliance and adherence, and just the simplicity of it ‚Äòone and done‚Äô,‚Äù Burton said.Moderna is currently running trials of a combined flu and COVID vaccine and will soon launch a phase-one study of a shot that can fight influenza, coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).‚ÄúWe would aim to have this [product] authorised for flu and COVID for maybe late 2023 early 2024, it is right around the corner,‚Äù Burton said.The company has chosen a site for its Melbourne production facility, and is set to announce its location in the two months once the deal has been formalised. The company will make up to 100 million vaccines a year under a ten-year deal, with the site set to come online in 2024.Rugby league has made a ruling on transgender athletes, banning them from competing in this weekend‚Äôs Test matches and the upcoming women‚Äôs World Cup, which will be held concurrently with the men‚Äôs event in October and November in England.On Sunday, swimming‚Äôs world governing body FINA voted to restrict the participation of transgender athletes in elite women‚Äôs competitions. It will create a working group to establish an ‚Äúopen‚Äù category for transgender athletes in some events.The International Rugby League made the ruling on male-to-female players ahead of this weekend‚Äôs representative round, a decision that will stand ‚Äúuntil further research is completed into the issue.‚Äù‚ÄúThe IRL is continuing work to review and update rules about transgender participation in women‚Äôs international rugby league and will seek to use the upcoming World Cup to help develop a comprehensive inclusion policy,‚Äù the governing body wrote in a missive to its member nations.‚ÄúUntil further research is completed to enable the IRL to implement a formal transgender inclusion policy, male-to-female (transwomen) players are unable to play in sanctioned women‚Äôs international rugby league matches.World soccer‚Äôs governing body FIFA and World Athletics are also reviewing their transgender eligibility policies after swimming passed new rules that restrict transgender participation in women‚Äôs events.Sebastian Coe, president of World Athletics, said his organisation‚Äôs council would discuss transgender regulations at the end of the year.Coe praised FINA‚Äôs decision, which has been criticised by trans rights advocates.‚ÄúWe see an international federation asserting its primacy in setting rules, regulations and policies that are in the best interest of its sport,‚Äù he told the BBC.A spokesperson for FIFA said it had also started a consultation process over a new policy.‚ÄúFIFA is currently reviewing its gender eligibility regulations in consultation with expert stakeholders,‚Äù said the spokesperson.Today is the shortest day of the year in the southern hemisphere, with just under 10 hours of daylight expected for Sydney and Melbourne on the winter solstice.The sun rises over Sydney‚Äôs harbour on the winter solstice on Tuesday.Credit:Brook MitchellFrom Wednesday, sunset will shift by a minute every two days.The tilt of the earth and the specific point that it will be at in its oval-shaped trajectory around the sun mean the southern hemisphere will be at its furthest point from the sun.But for the early birds hoping this marks the end of their dark mornings, it‚Äôs actually going to get worse before it gets better. As it stands, day broke at 6.59am in Sydney. Until the end of the first week of July, it‚Äôll stretch to 7.01am before eventually encroaching earlier towards the middle of July.Dawn at the Sydney Opera House this morning with an afterglow caused by a Volcanic eruption in Tonga.Credit:Brook MitchellThe same goes for Melbourne ‚Äì after a 7.35am wake-up start for the city, by early July the sun will rise at 7.37am.Sydneysiders and Melburnians should spare a thought for those in Tasmania who are in for a mere nine hours of daylight today, while some parts of Antarctica will experience two hours of daylight.Home buyers are being warned by the Reserve Bank to prepare for more interest rate rises, saying it has to get the cost of money back to a normal level to head off inflation pressures that would leave all Australians worse off.RBA governor Philip Lowe, speaking to the American Chamber of Commerce in Australia in Sydney on Tuesday morning, said the bank was committed to doing what was required to bring inflation back to within its 2 to 3 per cent target band.Reserve Bank governor Phillip Lowe.Credit:Renee NowytargerLowe said home buyers, who took on record levels of debt through the Covid recession, said they should be prepared for more interest rate pain.‚ÄúAs we chart our way back to 2 to 3 per cent inflation, Australians should be preparedfor more interest rate increases,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúThe level of interest rates is still very low for an economy with low unemployment and that is experiencing high inflation.‚ÄùBut Lowe added a key caveat to the bank‚Äôs thinking, saying the RBA would focus its attention on household spending through coming months.‚ÄúI want to emphasise though that we are not on a pre-set path. How fast we increase interest rates, and how far we need to go, will be guided by the incoming data and the board‚Äôs assessment of the outlook for inflation and the labour market,‚Äù he said.RBA governor Philip Lowe is speaking to the American Chamber of Commerce in Australia in Sydney this morning.You can watch the full speech live below.1 of 3Copyright ¬© 2022",",Adam Bandt Australian flag,Jimmy Carr,Shortest day of the year, Fatima Payman,Kyrie Irving",Adam Bandt Australian flag

This is unfortunate from my perspective, as it would be interesting to compare Labor‚Äôs strength during its honeymoon period with that of newly elected governments past. It also means I have to work harder on material for regular open thread posts. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve got this time:‚Ä¢ The Reuters Institute last week published its international Digital News Report 2022, the Australian segment of which was conducted by the University of Canberra, which asked questions on media consumption and trust. Respondents were asked to rank their trust in various media brands on a scale of one to ten. Typically for such surveys, this found the highest level of trust in public broadcasters, with ABC News ranking first and SBS News ranking second; television networks and broadsheet newspapers in the middle; and tabloid newspapers, specifically the Herald Sun and the Daily Telegraph, ranking last. The survey was conducted online in January and February from a sample of 2038.‚Ä¢ In an address to the National Press Club last week, Labor national secretary Paul Erickson dated a shift in voter sentiment in Labor‚Äôs favour from the announcement of the Solomon Islands‚Äô pact with China on April 1. Erickson said voters were struck by the contrast between the Coalition‚Äôs ‚Äúimmature‚Äù warmongering rhetoric and attempts to associate Labor with the Chinese Communist Party and Labor‚Äôs promise to ‚Äúrestore Australia‚Äôs place as the partner of choice‚Äù for Pacific Islands countries. He further noted that the rot set in for Scott Morrison amid COVID outbreaks in mid-2021, when Labor internal polling showed his net competence score fall by 14 points in two weeks over late June and early July. The Coalition was also damaged by cabinet ministers‚Äô partisan attacks on state governments in Western Australia and Victoria, and it was rated lower by voters on housing and wages.‚Ä¢ Saturday‚Äôs Financial Review reported on the Australian Electoral Commission‚Äôs efforts to confront online disinformation about the election process head on, through the work of its election integrity assurance taskforce and a media unit that abandoned bureaucratic formality in engaging with social media on social media‚Äôs terms. Electoral commissioner Tom Rogers claimed they had a ‚Äú70 to 80 per cent success rate in changing minds‚Äù, and that Twitter had been ‚Äúa bit self-correcting as a result‚Äù: ‚ÄúSomeone would say something and you‚Äôd see people say, ‚Äòhang on, that doesn‚Äôt sound right, I heard the AEC say this or that‚Äô‚Äù.‚Ä¢ Tom Rogers also foreshadows possible changes to electoral laws to allow for faster counting of postal votes after election day by streamlining the existing process whereby ballots are sorted at a central location and then sent to the voter‚Äôs electorate before they are counted.‚Ä¢ Nominations for the South Australian state by-election for Bragg on July 2 closed on Thursday, drawing a field of six candidates who are listed on my by-election guide.Other recent posts on the site:‚Ä¢ A post on the Queensland Senate result, which was confirmed on Thursday.

		If it gets a dormant debate on national symbols going then good on Bandt. Symbolism is politically important and always has been. The current flag is pure cringe, an international embarrassment. Steve777‚Äôs option is pretty much the best realistic option.Jan 6 @ #592 Tuesday, June 21st, 2022 ‚Äì 10:11 amWe can walk and chew gum. No reason for the change of flag debate to be sidelined. I dont like the flag for reasons other than its potential negative symbolism to first Australians. But also that as well. I have little time for the argument that ‚Äòmy grandfather fought under that flag‚Äô, countless people have died under flags that no longer fly (or should no longer fly). Countries change, they mature. There is no longer a place for the union jack on our flag ‚Äì simple as that, no matter any positive or neutral things it may represent in our history. The federation star, despite some negative connotations, is far more important. And if we were to have an Australia Day, the first circumnavigation is more far more apt than Sydney Colony Day.I have some sympathy for the backlash against Bandt. Leaders like this who support our indigenous peoples should be mindful of their main game. It came across as a stunt for airtime. And Bandt doesnt carry those stunts well. However, I dont believe it does the main game much (if any) harm to have a minor party making big demands ‚Äì almost like an ambit claim. But they can do to the Greens brand harm and it runs the risk of marginalising the flag change movement. Unfortunately, small parties feel the need to do this sort of thing in the media climate we are in if they want to increase and even maintain their vote shares. IMHO, stunts like these would be more carefully presented and handled by SHY. I have rarely voted Greens in the last 10 years so I am reluctant to comment on their leadership -except I may well feel the need to vote for them again.Disagree, these are one or the other issues, which together are a tool for division and conflation.Together they do not facilitate considered debate.The Eureka flag and the Aboriginal flag offer a template for a flag design.I am never sure why people want the eureka flag. It is quite a messy symbol. It could so easily be hijacked by antigovernment cray crays. I quite like the symbology of the one posted earlier. Federation star. Deep blue colour of the ocean/night sky. Southern Cross.Badnt just threw indigenous people under the bus. He wants them to fight for him. He picks fights knowing that the people who will be most hurt will be the indigenous people seeking reconciliation. It‚Äôs Dutton/Morrison worthy bastardry.Adam Bandt
@AdamBandt
Let me be clear.The Greens were the first party to support the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full, and we still do.This land always was First Nations land, it always will be, and we all need to take steps to ensure First Nations justice.

Labor does not need Greens in the House ‚Ä¶ they have a majority.In the senate is another question, But Greens would be unwise to stymie good legislation out of sheer bloody-mindedness.If they honestly want to improve things (and are not trying to stay alive by keeping its founding issues without resolution) like climate change mitigation, or Aboriginal issues, they need to stop selfishly saying ‚Äòour way or the highway‚Äô.Bandt has stated unequivocally the Greens will work to improve, not block.Rex Douglas @ #607 Tuesday, June 21st, 2022 ‚Äì 10:25 amAdam Bandt
@AdamBandt
Let me be clear.The Greens were the first party to support the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full, and we still do.This land always was First Nations land, it always will be, and we all need to take steps to ensure First Nations justice.

I agree with Bandt.So you don‚Äôt fully support the Statement from the Heart as well.Bandt not standing in front of a flag , Abbott standing in front of eleventy flags. Two sides of a very sad coin.Pi @ #606 Tuesday, June 21st, 2022 ‚Äì 10:24 amBadnt just threw indigenous people under the bus. He wants them to fight for him. He picks fights knowing that the people who will be most hurt will be the indigenous people seeking reconciliation. It‚Äôs Dutton/Morrison worthy bastardry.But Lidia‚Äôs happy.Barney, I agree that the flag is a second (or third or fourth) order issue. The main game are the aims in the Statement From the Heart. The Greens jumping up and down shouldnt get in the way of that. It seems to be uniting the indigenous community around the Statement ‚Äì from what I have heard they are almost unanimously dismissive of what Bandt has done. And it may also unite others around it to. It unfortunately marginalises Bandt and the Greens.I have no doubt some on the right will point at this as a way to divide and damage the cause. But they are just preaching to the converted fringe. My feel is it wont damage the chances of a successful referendum vote. We just need to get to that.No not the bloody coat of arms!! Gross. A flag should use clear, clean shapes. Basic design principles. Easy for a kid to draw.Rex Douglas @ #610 Tuesday, June 21st, 2022 ‚Äì 10:30 amJenAuthor @ #584 Tuesday, June 21st, 2022 ‚Äì 11:18 amve

Bandt has stated unequivocally the Greens will work to improve, not block.Who is he to ‚Äúimprove‚Äù it?Such a paternalistic attitude.They almost got it right, but we‚Äôll fix it for them.Adam, they‚Äôre not Labor‚Äôs words, they are the words of the indigenous community.It‚Äôs a precarious maneuver posing yourself as a champion of indigenous rights while simultaneously hating on an indigenous Senator.Jan 6 says:

To successfully change the flag has to have widespread support so while your point has always been the argument against the Eureka flag but its one flag design that has support from the far left and far right. I also like the Aboriginal flag but the reactionaries will take a hissy fit if that became the flag but these flags could be used in designing a new flag.

Yeah, that was my first thought too.  But could an ultra-stylized version do?  Say just a basic sketch of a kangaroo facing an emu or something like that?Mexicanbeemer @ #617 Tuesday, June 21st, 2022 ‚Äì 12:37 pmJan 6 says:

I don‚Äôt hate Thorpe.2. It may seem so to someone as superficial as you. Thorpe has taken a personal position on the issue, which she has every right to do, but she has then taken that position and made it the Greens‚Äô position, changing the Greens‚Äô policy from one that reflected the majority indigenous view to a minority one.When did bandt first remove the flag from his press conferences?Did anyone notice?Bob @ #623 Tuesday, June 21st, 2022 ‚Äì 10:50 amWhen did bandt first remove the flag from his press conferences?Did anyone notice?It was done yesterday, I think by a staffer, in front of the waiting media.Bandt achieved excellent 2022 electoral returns for the Greens.I‚Äôm happy to say I was wrong pre-election when I called for a leadership hand-over to Waters.Well done Bandt.If a flag can‚Äôt be drawn and coloured in by an 8 year old then it defeats the purpose of having a flag ‚Äì something to rally around to send young men off to fight.
Flag must be easy to sewBandt has apparently been doing the flag thing since 2020.Expect more of these sorts of stunts from Bandt. Bandt needs to keep the ‚Äúleft renewal‚Äù aligned Greens on side in order to retain the leadership. With the additional Greens MPs in Parliament, some from the radical left faction, he will need to adequately virtue signal to them otherwise he could be replaced by Thorpe, Shoebridge or someone else.C@tmommasays:

It‚Äôs the shortest day of the year everyone!
And to celebrate our headlong rush back to ANOTHER La Nina next Summer (50/50), we will be meeting up between 11.30 and 12 tomorrow, on Dixon Street, outside of the Nine Dragons restaurant.
Be there, or be a Liberal voter!

‚ÄúI have long believed this decline is terminal
It was bad enough the first time but when the US of A re-elected Dubya Bush I penciled that in as the inflection point for them.‚ÄùI was living there during the ‚Äòdimpled chads‚Äô election, it was both hilarious then worrying to realise how fragile things really were under the very thin veneer of being a superpower.Premier Peter Malinauskas told reporters a short time ago that the Emergency Management Council decided this morning not to ease any remaining restrictions ‚Äì including vaccination mandates for allied health workers ‚Äì after new modelling showed SA could expect cases to rise now that the BA.5 strain had been detected in the state.https://indaily.com.au/news/2022/06/21/covid-restrictions-stay-amid-new-variant-warnings/When you present yourself under a flag, banner, or badge, I presume you are making a statement about who whom whatevs you represent and stand for. So I reckon Bandt sidelining or removing the current Australian flag was an unnecessary middle finger to a lot of voters. The presence of the aboriginal flag was all that was necessary. I don‚Äôt vote green. I don‚Äôt like or want the current flag.FWIW, any flag should be simple and difficult to mix up with flags from other nations (ie: NZ).New laws to create an independent authority to oversee Victoria‚Äôs treaty negotiations are set to pass with bipartisan support.Excellent news re tomorrows parliamentary vote.Tim Smith, however, doesn‚Äôt like it.Liberal MP Tim Smith, who will not recontest his seat in November after a drink-driving crash, said he does not support ‚Äúilliberal and divisive tokenism‚Äù and will vote against the legislation.‚ÄúI will be crossing the floor,‚Äù he tweeted.https://www.standard.net.au/story/7788709/bipartisan-support-for-vic-treaty-body/Q: The Emergency Management Council decided this morning not to ease any remaining restrictionsI am a state health worker and get the Emergency Bulletins about the state of the health system‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt think people understand the scale of the crisis in our major hospitals at the moment. This morning‚Äôs bulletin was DIRE.  DIRE.Ross Gittins out of the blocks on the all singing all dancing Kean / Perrottet budget.Genuine action on climate change, measures to improve the treatment of women in the workplace and the home, promoting co-operation rather than conflict and division, increased spending on early education, childcare and hospitals, the educated talking to the educated, Perrottet‚Äôs rejection of the pork barrelling condoned by his predecessor ‚Äì this budget has everything.I give you ‚Ä¶ Australia‚Äôs first teal budget.https://www.smh.com.au/politics/nsw/perrottet-s-bold-re-election-bid-the-world-s-first-teal-budget-20220620-p5av6o.htmlSo the Libs parade the flag out to disguise the hollowness of the message and our media laps it up.But Bandt simply refuses to do use a signal and he‚Äôs accused of virtue signalling.If Sky news is pissed at you, you‚Äôve probably done the right thing.Talking about the flag is complementary to talk about Treaty and Republic. It‚Äôs continuing the conversation about our national identity and how we should be moving away from things we‚Äôve always done to things that are good. The old flag is a symbol of our mistreatment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It‚Äôs a symbol of our subservience to England. Accusing him from distracting from these linked causes is ridiculous. It‚Äôs like saying we have a limited supply of ‚Äòbeing a decent person‚Äô and we shouldn‚Äôt use it or we‚Äôll run out. It‚Äôs like claiming that people shouldn‚Äôt stand up against homophobia because we should be focussed on standing up against sexism.We get it, you hate everyone who isn‚Äôt Labor. You don‚Äôt have to make up reasons to justify your hatred. Just accept that you hate him regardless of his words or actions.Voice Endeavour

Comedian Jimmy Carr's father has said his son should be stripped of a 2013 honour given to him by Limerick City over ""insults"" in his book.Comic Jimmy was presented with a Certificate of Irish Heritage by Limerick politicians as part of the Gathering Ireland initiative in 2013.But now his dad, Jimmy Carr Snr, has called for the honour to be rescinded unless the comic issues a public apology to the city for a comment in his book. Jimmy Carr and his father have both previously spoken about the breakdown of their relationship and the pair have not spoken in years.In his 2021 book, 'Jimmy Carr, Before and Laughter', the Channel Four host made a quip about his parents' decision to move to Slough.He wrote: ""I might seem urbane, but I‚Äôm the son of two immigrants from Limerick who moved to Slough (they moved from a sh** town to another sh** town, I guess they knew what they liked).""Speaking to the Limerick Leader, Jimmy snr blasted the joke and demanded an aology for the city.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the style of his comedy. ‚ÄúI am not shocked or surprised that my son referred to Limerick and Slough as [sh** towns ]. ""He is, after all, a shock jock. His defence will be ‚Äòthey are only words, I‚Äôm only having a laugh‚Äô.

            ""But there are people reading that Limerick is a s*** town and Slough is a s*** town. ""Ironically, we didn‚Äôt move to Slough, we moved from Limerick to South Kensington, London,‚Äù Jim said.The businessman also slammed his son for including the joke: ‚ÄúHow many potatoes does it take to kill an Irishman?‚Äù in his book.‚ÄúThe Famine - that‚Äôs our Holocaust for God‚Äôs sake,‚Äù said Jim.Referring to the breakdown of their relationship, Jimmy snr said he was not happy with how he has been portrayed by his famous son.‚ÄúI love him, of course, like a son but I am still very active in business and I can‚Äôt be having my name sullied by innuendo.""Last year, the 8 Out of 10 Cats presenter did an interview saying he wants a healthier relationship with his own son who was born in 2019, than he had with his own father.Speaking on the Parenting Hell podcast with hosts Rob Beckett and Josh Widdicombe, Carr said that while he wants ""the best"" for his father, he doesn't want him in his life. ""It‚Äôs not a secret, I haven‚Äôt seen my dad in 21 years and you know the line, 'My mother‚Äôs dead and my father‚Äôs dead to me' ‚Äì which sounds very cold, until you meet the guy,‚Äù he joked.

            ""It‚Äôs a weird thing where I‚Äôm acutely aware that things don‚Äôt always work out‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm aware that sometimes it goes the other way and that could be terrible and there‚Äôs no bitterness and there‚Äôs no anger there.""I want the best, I just can‚Äôt have that guy in my life,"" he added. ""There‚Äôs a bit of sadness there and you worry, 'Could something go wrong with my kid?' You want to prevent that, but it‚Äôs hard. ""I think it‚Äôs about being a father and being that figure for him but not in any way controlling."" His relationship with his father ended shortly before the death of Jimmy‚Äôs mother, Nora Mary, who died in September 2001. The comic referred to ‚Äúlosing‚Äù his mother and father at the same time but said he was grateful to have ‚Äúenough father figures and mother figures in life‚Äù.Last year, Jimmy Carr came under fire for a joke featured in his Netflix special His Dark Materials.The 49-year-old made light about the murder of Gypsies during the Holocaust, saying: ‚ÄúWhen people talk about the Holocaust, they talk about the tragedy and horror of six million Jewish lives being lost to the Nazi war machine.‚ÄúBut they never mention the thousands of Gypsies that were killed by the Nazis. No one ever talks about that because no one wants to talk about the positives.‚ÄùMartin Collins, co-director of Traveller and Roma rights organisation Pavee Point, said that Carr‚Äôs comments were ‚Äúdangerous and concerning.‚Äù‚ÄúThese comments from Jimmy Carr go beyond racism, he actually glorifies genocide,‚Äù he told Newstalk Breakfast.""Let's remember: a minimum of 500,000 Roma Gypsies were persecuted by the Nazis during the Second World War - men, women and children.‚ÄúAnd then this guy takes to the stage, and he begins to trivialise and make fun of this terrible genocide.‚ÄúSo he is, in effect, glorifying genocide which is extremely dangerous and concerning.‚ÄùNow download the free app for all the latest Sunday World News, Crime, Irish Showbiz and Sport.

The Lost Toys, Tastes and Trends of the '70s and '80s,"" as well as ""The Totally Sweet '90s."" If Marathon candy bars ever come back, she'll be first in line.Here it is, the day many of us longed for during those short, dark, cold winter days. Tuesday, June 21, is the longest day of the year, celebrated as the summer solstice. If you want to get up early to savor it, technically, the solstice occurs at 5:14 a.m. ET in the US. Here are some basic solstice facts.As the Farmer's Almanac explains, the solstice occurs ""when Earth arrives at the point in its orbit where the North Pole is at its maximum tilt"" toward the sun, or about 23.5 degrees, which translates to ""the longest day and shortest night"" of the year. (By longest ""day,"" we mean the longest period of sunlight hours.) On the day of the June solstice, the Northern Hemisphere receives sunlight at the most direct angle of the year.""The solstice isn't always on the same date. In 2023, it'll be on June 21 again, but in 2024 and 2025, it'll be on June 22.The June solstice means something different to people living in the southern hemisphere, where it's the shortest day of the year, and marks the beginning of winter.The amount of sun you'll get depends on where you live.¬†You can figure it out for your city by going to TimeAndDate.com, entering in your city, and clicking on Sun & Moon. The further north you are, the more sun. Minneapolis and Seattle, you get 15 hours, 59 minutes of sun. Boston, 15 hours, 17 minutes. San Francisco, 14 hours, 47 minutes. Los Angeles, 14 hours, 26 minutes. Dallas, you get 14 hours, 19 minutes. Miami, 13 hours 45 minutes.¬†And let's talk about the Land of the Midnight Sun. Anchorage, Alaska, gets 19 hours, 21 minutes. But Fairbanks gets a whopping 21 hours, 49 minutes. And at the very top of the state, in Utqiaƒ°vik, Alaska, the sun is up for 24 hours. It's worth going to their Farmer's Almanac page just to marvel at that.Some countries and cultures really get into celebrating the solstice.¬†Sweden calls it Midsummer, and always celebrates on a June Friday, so will mark the solstice on June 24 instead of June 21. Traditional festivities there include folk dancing, wreath making, and maypole raising. (And you may have seen the 2019 horror movie Midsommar, which depicts a fictional and very scary midsummer celebration.)In Seattle, home of that luxurious 16 hours of sun, the traditional Solstice Parade and Fair returned to the city's Fremont neighborhood after taking two years off during the pandemic. That celebration occurred on June 18, and featured the event's traditional naked bicyclist ride (cyclists wear elaborate body paint).And at England's iconic Stonehenge, festivities also returned after two years of no celebrations.

                                        Kyrie Irving has made it clear that he would prefer to remain in Brooklyn with the Nets at every turn. ""There's no way I can leave my man seven [Kevin Durant] anywhere,"" he¬†said in March. When the Nets were eliminated from the playoffs by the Boston Celtics, Irving reiterated his plans. ""I don't really plan on going anywhere,"" he told the assembled press as Brooklyn's season ended. But as free agency inches closer and closer, it's growing less likely that Irving remains with the team that he signed with the last time he had freedom of movement in 2019.Contract talks between Irving and the Nets have hit an impasse, and that has forced Irving to consider other possible destinations, according to¬†The Athletic. Irving has a player option that he can use to become a free agent in July, and that gives him meaningful leverage with the Nets in terms of landing with a preferred destination. According to Shams Charania, the Lakers, Clippers and Knicks would all be interested in Irving if he becomes available.
                                                    
    The Knicks are likely the single-most important team involved in these proceedings because unlike the Lakers and the Clippers, they at least have somewhat plausible paths to cap space. While the Knicks are roughly at the cap line for next season, they have a number of reasonably moveable salaries that they could dump by attaching draft capital. Charania names Evan Fournier, Alec Burks, Nerlens Noel and Kemba Walker as candidates. This is so important because none of the teams with major cap space are expected to be contenders next season. If the Nets only had to compete with teams like the Magic and Pacers, they likely wouldn't be worried. But an alternative within New York City poses a genuine threat. If the Nets don't cooperate in sending Irving to the destination of his choice in a trade, he can threaten to simply walk to the Knicks for nothing.The Lakers and Clippers cannot create the cap space necessary to sign Irving outright, but both would surely have interest in adding the star point guard through a trade. Such a trade would rely on Irving opting into the final year and $36.3 million on his deal because sign-and-trade transactions create a hard cap at the luxury tax apron that neither team is equipped to deal with. Irving would then presumably negotiate an extension from there.The Lakers would likely have to build their package around Russell Westbrook as matching salary in such a deal. Westbrook also has a player option this offseason, and will cost more than $47 million when he inevitably picks it up. Brooklyn's interest in Westbrook is likely to be tepid. The Nets already have a poor shooter in Ben Simmons¬†who they will have to build an offense around. In all likelihood, the Nets would prefer to send Westbrook to a third team. What should interest the Nets in making such a deal would be the two unprotected first-round picks the Lakers can offer deep into the future in 2027 and 2029. By that point, LeBron James will be in his 40s and those picks could be quite valuable. James and Irving won a championship together in Cleveland and may relish the opportunity to reunite.The Clippers have a similar connection to Irving through head coach Ty Lue, who worked with both Irving and James in Cleveland as they won the 2016 title. Unlike the Lakers, the Clippers have just a single first-round pick to dangle (2028). Their salary ballast is much more palatable, however, as it is attached to valuable role players like Norman Powell, Luke Kennard and Reggie Jackson as opposed to Westbrook. As Charania notes, the Clippers have young players like Terance Mann and Brandon Boston to throw into a possible deal. Paying Irving wouldn't be much of an issue for Steve Ballmer, who has already invested hundreds of millions of dollars into next season's roster.¬†If Irving truly does leave Brooklyn, the Nets could easily fall out of the championship race entirely. After accumulating three on-ball superstars, Brooklyn might soon be down to just one.¬†¬© 2004-2022 CBS Interactive. All Rights Reserved.CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

An impasse currently exists among the parties that clears the way for the seven-time All-Star to consider the open marketplace, those sources said.""Irving, 30, has until June 29 to pick up a $36.9 million player option to stay with the Nets. If he declines the option, he could reportedly test free agency.The Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Clippers and New York Knicks are among the teams who could be interested in Irving, per Charania. The Lakers and Clippers would likely need to facilitate a sign-and-trade for Irving, while the Knicks could sign Irving outright in free agency.It's a frightening development for the Nets, who saw Irving in only 29 regular-season games this past season after he declined to take the COVID-19 vaccine. That decision made him ineligible to play at Brooklyn's home games until March 27. He averaged 27.4 points, 5.8 assists, 4.4 rebounds and shot 46.9 percent from the field when available and averaged 21.3 points, 5.3 rebounds and 5.3 assists during the Nets' lone playoff series.About an hour after Charania's story landed, Irving tweeted a video of a man laughing. This could be coincidental, or a reference to the ""impasse"" report. We'll leave that interpretation up for NBA Twitter.pic.twitter.com/1NuxXUan7Z‚Äî A11Even (@KyrieIrving) June 20, 2022There have been conflicting sentiments between Irving and the Nets about their future since Brooklyn was swept by the Boston Celtics in the first round of the playoffs.Irving said in April he didn't ""really plan on going anywhere"" but felt he and Kevin Durrant deserved a ""managing"" role alongside Brooklyn general manager Sean Marks.""I don't really plan on going anywhere,"" Irving said. ""This is added motivation for our franchise to be at the top of the league for the next few years. I'm just looking forward to the summer and building with our guys here.""""When I say I'm here with Kev, I think that really entails us managing this franchise together alongside Joe and Sean, just our group of family members that we have in our locker room and our organization.""The Nets don't appear as committed to Irving. When asked about Irving‚Äôs future in mid-May, Marks said they wanted players who ‚Äúplay selfless‚Äù and ‚Äúbe available,‚Äù perhaps a reference to Irving‚Äôs decision to not get vaccinated.‚ÄúI think we know what we‚Äôre looking for,‚Äù Marks said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking for guys that want to come in here, be part of something bigger than themselves, play selfless, play team basketball, and be available. That goes not only for Kyrie but for everybody here.‚ÄùIn any event, this will be a pivotal offseason for the Nets. The heralded duo of Irving and Durant is now in doubt, even after playing only 44 games together since joining the Nets in 2019. The addition of Ben Simmons at the trade deadline could soften the blow of an Irving departure, but it's unclear how effective the former Philadelphia 76er could be after missing the entire 2021-22 season.What Irving and the Nets decide could have wide-ranging implications in the Eastern Conference. Brooklyn currently has the third-best odds to win the 2022-23 NBA Finals at +700, per BetMGM. That could easily change in the next nine days, though, if Irving and the Nets break up.The Buccaneers signing of defensive tackle Akiem Hicks on June 1 signaled the end of the line for Ndamukong Suh in Tampa.

""So when Steve Nash had the team on the floor, and they practiced, they would finish and he'd go and get five guys and conduct his own practice. ... Do you have any idea how disrespectful that is to Steve Nash?""Smith's report comes on the same day that Shams Charania wrote for The Athletic that ""conversations about Irving's future have gone stagnant between him and the Nets"" and that an ""impasse currently exists among the parties"" that could open the door to his departure.Irving has a $36.5 million player option for next season with a June 29 deadline for whether to exercise it or decline it and become a free agent.The Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers and New York Knicks are the teams most interested in acquiring Irving if he doesn't return to Brooklyn, per Charania.Amid Monday's reports, Irving sent the following cryptic tweet of The Wire's Brother Mouzone:<a href=""https://t.co/1NuxXUan7Z"">pic.twitter.com/1NuxXUan7Z</a>Irving's time in Brooklyn has been eventful, to say the least.Upon Nash's hiring as head coach in 2020, Irving raised some eyebrows when he suggested the role would be more of a group effort.""I don't really see us having a head coach,"" he said on Kevin Durant's podcast The ETCs. ""You know what I mean? KD could be a head coach. I could be a head coach.""He played just 20 games for the Nets in the 2019-20 season as a shoulder injury and knee sprain cost him time. He played in 54 games in 2020-21, though a sprained ankle left him unavailable for the last three games of the team's Eastern Conference Semifinals matchup with the Milwaukee Bucks as they were eliminated in seven games.Irving then played just 29 games for the Nets last season.
